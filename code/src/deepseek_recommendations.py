        The White House is preparing to announce on Monday that it won’t impose any new
        tariffs on solar imports for two years, in a move that is aimed at getting stalled solar-power
        projects on track, according to people familiar with the decision. The decision would be a
        win for U.S. solar developers and utilities—which are highly dependent on imported solar
        panels—and a loss for manufacturers trying to build up a domestic solar supply chain.
        The decision would come in the wake of the Commerce Department’s decision to investigate
        whether Chinese solar producers are illegally circumventing solar tariffs by routing operations
        through four countries in Southeast Asia—Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. If
        the investigation concludes that tariffs were being circumvented, it could lead to levies being
        imposed retroactively on imports from those countries—a scenario that created a chilling
        effect on new solar development, according to several companies and lawmakers. Companies
        including NextEra Energy Inc. and Xcel Energy Inc. have said the solar-panel probe could
        significantly delay solar projects, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom told the Commerce
        Department it would delay numerous new solar and battery storage projects expected to
        come online through 2024. By announcing the two-year pause in any new tariffs, the White
        House is trying to give more certainty to developers and utilities that have complained its
        trade policies are causing the slowdown in adding new solar capacity nationwide, according to
        a senior administration official. At the same time, the Commerce Department investigation
        would continue, the official said. The probe was launched after California-based Auxin Solar
        Inc., a small maker of solar panels, accused Chinese companies of circumventing tariffs by
        routing operations through Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia that then export
        materials to the U.S.
        The company said that Chinese solar producers have sought to undercut U.S. manufacturers by 
         shifting production to countries not covered by tariffs. The International Energy
        Agency said last month new solar development in the U.S. is on pace to decline 6.8% this
        year—one of the few places in the world it is slowing down—because of uncertainty over tax
        and trade policy. In addition to the two-year pause on new solar tariffs, administration offi-
        cials say the White House will unveil plans to increase domestic solar manufacturing capacity
        to 22.5 gigawatts by 2024, or three times the manufacturing capacity when President Biden
        took office. That would enable millions of homes to switch to solar energy, the officials said.
        Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Associa-
        tion, cheered the expected action from Mr. Biden to pause new tariffs. These steps “protect
        existing solar jobs, will lead to increased employment in the solar industry and foster a ro-
        bust solar manufacturing base here at home,” she said. The levies on imported solar cells
        and modules apply to products made in China. Known as antidumping and countervailing
        duties, they were first imposed by the Obama administration in 2012. The investigation
        could extend those tariffs to cells and modules completed in Cambodia, Malaysia or Viet-
        nam, using parts and components from China. Those countries now produce roughly 80%
        of U.S. solar imports. The tariff issue has split the solar industry, pitting solar installers
        who buy imported panels against U.S. manufacturers who want protection from what they
        see as cut-rate Chinese competitors. Mr. Biden has been caught between these competing
        interests—on the one hand hoping to boost U.S. manufacturing and on the other hoping to
        accelerate the transition to clean renewable energy. Mr. Biden must also decide what to do
        with the tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports inherited from the Trump
        administration amid escalating inflation and the need to confront China. Many businesses,
        economists and even some in his own administration such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen,
        have pressed the president to eliminate some of the tariffs as a way to ease inflation pressure.
        Mr. Biden himself has said tackling inflation is his “top economic priority.” But Mr. Biden
        also faces growing pressure to stand tough against China’s economic practices as the war in
        Ukraine fuels worries about authoritarian governments

# ========================================SAMPLE OUTPUT==================================================
sample_output = """Okay, so I need to figure out whether to buy any NYSE or Nasdaq stocks based on the provided news about Biden's announcement to withhold tariffs on solar imports for two years. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the main point of the news is that the US will stop imposing new tariffs on imported solar panels until 2024. This is good news for US-based solar manufacturers because they were worried their higher costs would make it harder to compete with cheaper Chinese solar panels. The White House said this move will give certainty to existing developers and utilities, helping them get ahead with projects that have been stalled.

But wait, even though the immediate impact on tariffs is positive, I remember that earlier Biden announced a massive plan to boost domestic manufacturing capacity by 22.5 gigawatts by 2024. That seems like a long-term strategic move beyond just pausing tariffs. The article mentions increasing manufacturing up to three times the current level under President Biden.

If their projects are moving forward because of this, that suggests businesses involved in solar energy production will see growth and expansion opportunities. More jobs could be created as factories are built and solar panels are produced domestically. This trend might drive stock prices higher for companies involved in solar manufacturing or energy infrastructure.

However, I should consider the broader economic context mentioned in the Wall Street Journal. They pointed out that many businesses and economists are pushing Biden to remove some tariffs to ease inflationary pressure. Inflation is a major concern because high demand from war in Ukraine has pushed up prices across the board, including energy supplies. Tariffs on Chinese goods could be contributing factors here.

So, if the government might further crack down on Chinese imports by lifting some existing tariffs or maybe new ones, this could increase competition even further for US manufacturers. That uncertainty might weigh on their growth prospects despite the pause because future policies are still unknown.

I'm also thinking about the supply chain issues that come with making more solar panels domestically. Even if production increases, factors like transportation costs, labor availability, and potential government regulations could pose challenges.

Another angle is how this announcement affects not just US-based manufacturers but also companies that rely on imported solar panels. If they can now get certainty in their projects, maybe they won't increase their orders as much until more info comes out, which might actually slow down the ramp-up of domestic production.

So weighing these factors: positive news about pause and long-term manufacturing plans versus potential future changes in trade policies to tackle inflation by lifting tariffs. If the White House signals that they will only pause new tariffs for now but keep an eye on changing conditions in their larger strategy, it might mean a cautious positive outlook rather than a surge.

Also, looking at the industry trends, the solar and renewable energy sector has been growing steadily, but this seems to be a significant boost aimed at accelerating the shift. More companies are likely to invest more now knowing that at least for a couple of years, their prices aren't going to spiral out of control due to tariffs.

But since inflation is high, maybe higher costs on materials or energy could still impact their profit margins in the long run. However, this announcement might preempt some cost increases and allow companies to strategically increase their spending now with certainty about future policy.

Overall, the pause part is positive because it gives a short-term relief to manufacturers concerned about rising tariffs, but the long-term manufacturing plan is a longer-term opportunity. The combined effect may be somewhat bearish unless the increased production from 2024 specifically targets certain companies that are heavily involved in this initiative.
